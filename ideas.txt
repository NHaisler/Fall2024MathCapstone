If a system produced by SINDy "maintains randomness" then it is said to be a
random conserving, RC system
-How to define this. Choose some specific metrics to go off of to start,
and this can maybe be generalized to different methods of randomness
quantification


Maybe define some other important propertiess
-Sustained: The sampled system doesn't ever lose the other properties over
time.

1. Given initial conditions for a lorenz system, does there exists a time interval
and sample rate where SINDy produces an RC system
    -I believe this should be true, the trivial case is just give a very small
    dt so that the sampled system ends up being close to if not 100% accuracte
    to the original system. Although checking for non-trivial could be an important
    first step for next idea

2. Given initial conditions for a lorenz system, does there exist a minmimum
sample rate where SINDy produces an RC system
    -Stricter than previous, basically what is the highest I can make
    dt and RC. Possibly other properties

3. Given initial conditions for a lorenz system, and a corresponding RC system,
can we determine how long the sampled system is RC.
    -Same as sustained idea. Can the properties be guranteed to stay or will
    the system begin to do something weird
